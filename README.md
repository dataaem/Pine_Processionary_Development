This project concerns the development of pine processionary. The goal of this project is to predict the number of number of processionary nests by tree depending on :
- x1 altitude (in meters)
- x2 slope (in degree)
- x3 number of pines
- x4 height (in meters)
- x5 diameter of the tree (in meter)
- x6 density of population
- x7 orientation of the plot (1 south, 2 north)
- x8 height of dominant trees (in meters)
- x9 stratification of the vegetation
- x10 mixed poplatiion character (1 not mixed, 2 mixed)
